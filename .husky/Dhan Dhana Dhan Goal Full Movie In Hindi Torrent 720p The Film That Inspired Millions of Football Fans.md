This sentence describes a scientific study that investigated the effects of increased demand on the functions of astrocytes, which are a type of glial cell that support neurons in the brain. The study measured the expression of intermediate filaments and Na(+)/K(+)-ATPases in the astrocytes, which are proteins that are involved in maintaining the structure and function of the cells. The study found that after exposing rats to an osmotic challenge, which is a condition that alters the water balance in the body, the astrocytes in the light and dark maculae of the retina, which are regions that are responsible for vision, showed increased levels of mRNA for these proteins. mRNA is a molecule that carries the genetic information for making proteins.
